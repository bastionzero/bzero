# Bzero

## Bastionzero

Bastionzero is a simple to use zero trust access SaaS for dynamic cloud environments. Bastionzero is the most secure way to lock down remote access to servers, containers, clusters, and VMâ€™s in any cloud, public or private. For more information go to [Bastionzero](https://www.bastionzero.com).

The bzero-agent and bzero-daemon are executables that run on your local machine and target to communicate with the Bastionzero SaaS. 

## Install
We bundle our daemon with our cli tool `zli`: 
```
brew tap bastionzero/tap
brew install bastionzero/tap/zli
```

To install the Agent, you can quickly get started by looking at our [helm charts](https://github.com/bastionzero/charts).

## Developer processes

We use go to run and test our code. You can build our agent or daemon using the following command for our agent:
```
cd bctl/agent && go build agent.go
```

And this command for our daemon:
```
cd bctl/daemon && go build daemon.go
```

You can then run the agent and daemon by running the executable.

Where {version} is the version that is defined in the `package.json` file. This means older versions are still accessible but the `latest` folder will always overwritten by the codebuild job.
