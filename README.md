# Bzero

## Bastionzero

Bastionzero is a simple to use zero trust access SaaS for dynamic cloud environments. Bastionzero is the most secure way to lock down remote access to servers, containers, clusters, and VMâ€™s in any cloud, public or private. For more information go to [Bastionzero](https://www.bastionzero.com).

The bzero-agent and bzero-daemon are executables that run on your local machine and target to communicate with the Bastionzero SaaS. 

## Install
We bundle our daemon with our cli tool `zli`: 
```
brew tap bastionzero/tap
brew install bastionzero/tap/zli
```

To install the Agent, you can quickly get started by looking at our [helm charts](https://github.com/bastionzero/charts).

## Developer processes

We use go to run and test our code. You can build our agent or daemon using the following command for our agent:
```
cd bctl/agent && go build agent.go
```

And this command for our daemon:
```
cd bctl/daemon && go build daemon.go
```

You can then run the agent and daemon by running the executable.

Where {version} is the version that is defined in the `package.json` file. This means older versions are still accessible but the `latest` folder will always overwritten by the codebuild job.

## Testing

Unit tests are written using the [go testing package](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) for both the agent and daemon projects as well as for the common bzerolib library code. Tests should be written as close to the component they are testing (in the same directory as the files they test) and should have a `_test` filename suffix.

To find and run all unit tests within a go project first `cd` into the root directory of the project (or a subdirectory) and run the command `go test -v ./...`.

To run all daemon/agent unit tests:

```
cd bctl // you can also run more specific tests by cd'ing into a more specific directory like bctl/daemon
go test -v ./...
```

To run bzerolib unit tests:

```
cd bzerolib
go test -v ./...
```
